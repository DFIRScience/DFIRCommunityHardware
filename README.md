## DFIR Community Hardware Fund

A few days ago Alexis Brignoni posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexisBrignoni/status/1490758627489103882?s=20&t=dPy6eilC_Vf0p5lK39WTXw) about the increased usage of the Meta Quest 2 hardware. It's a device that digital investigators will likely need to analyze in the near future. The problem is that it's quite expensive.

Repository to track community hardware, data and funding.
