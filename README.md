## DFIR Community Hardware Fund

The DFIR Community Hardware Fund is a place to pool resources to purchase more expensive devices for community research. Desired hardware is identifed by the community, funds are raised to purchase the device, data sets are generated and released to the community, the hardware is shared for research among the funders. Donate to the DFIR Community Hardware Fund [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=S3GXPSXT8QRGL).

### Why a community hardware fund?

A few days ago, Alexis Brignoni posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexisBrignoni/status/1490758627489103882?s=20&t=dPy6eilC_Vf0p5lK39WTXw) about the increased usage of the *Meta Quest 2* hardware. It's one of many devices that digital investigators will likely need to analyze in the near future. The problem is that devices like these are quite expensive for individual researchers. This means access to high-quality hardware information and data sources provided by a few [exceedingly generous individuals](https://thebinaryhick.blog/2021/12/17/android-12-image-now-available/).

One answer to this challenge is for the community to pool resources. Researchers interested in a specific topic can propose hardware to be studied. The community then contributes funding for the hardware they are most interested in researching. We then use funded projects to purchase the hardware, create and release free test data sets for the community, and manage hardware distribution to other researchers and labs for their testing. Theoretically, this would give the entire community much faster access to data sets. That means more eyes on new devices and a faster research-to-investigation pipeline.

### Rules

* Anyone can request hardware to be funded. Create a pull request or [contact DFIRScience](https://dfir.science/contact).
* When donating, you can [select specific hardware projects to fund](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=S3GXPSXT8QRGL). Projects funded first will be processed first.
* Researchers and organizations that contribute to the fund can request the physical device for a limited time after the inital community data sets have been created.
* Any destructive research will need to be negotiated. Generally, destructive research should produce datasets or information freely-available to the community. [Contact DFIRScience](https://dfir.science/contact)
